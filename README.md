# recursion_ruby  

assignment to practice recursion  

1. Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this method should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].  

2. Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just 3 lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).
